# Ray-Okay
A quite simple Haskell raytracer written using the Gloss library.

By [Uwila](https://github.com/Uwila/) and [Ivo Gabe de Wolff](https://github.com/ivogabe) (only one of the authors is in the git history because it was squashed to remove some personal info). 

## Building
You can build the program using Cabal (part of the Haskell platform). In the root folder run 

`cabal install --only-dependencies`. 

After this you should be able to build and run the project using 

`cabal build` 

and 

`cabal run` 

respectively.
