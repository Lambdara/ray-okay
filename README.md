# Ray-Okay
A quite simple Haskell raytracer written using the Gloss library.

## Building
You can build the program using Cabal (part of the Haskell platform). In the root folder run 

`cabal install --only-dependencies`. 

After this you should be able to build and run the project using 

`cabal build` 

and 

`cabal run` 

respectively.
